        <p>A Clearance is defined as the act or process of clearing.</p>
        <p>The Student’s Online Clearance System (SOCS) is system that will systematically checks balances, 
            fees and other obligations of the students at the University of Southeastern Philippines through online.</p>
        <p>The main objective of this project is to have an easy way of signing clearance for the student and 
            also for the offices because this system is automated.</p>
        <p>The system also helps every student to accomplish their clearances without so much pressure on time.</p>
        <p>Every offices, departments and teachers have also their benefits in the system in such a way that they 
            can check student’s accounts ahead of time without pressuring their selves. They can have less work 
            during clearance day because all they have to do is to check on the students who have not yet complied 
            their requirements.</p>
